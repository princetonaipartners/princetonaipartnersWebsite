## 📋 What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Fixes

1. **Fixed Critical Scroll Bug**
   - **Problem**: Phone demo was forcing page to scroll back to top constantly
   - **Solution**: Changed from `scrollIntoView()` to `scrollTop` - chat scrolls within phone, not entire page
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:1435-1436, 1463-1466

2. **Interactive Scenario System**
   - Added 4 clickable scenario buttons: Book Appointment, Ask Question, Emergency, After Hours
   - Rebuilt all conversation flows (4-6 messages each)
   - Fixed timeout bugs causing message overlap
   - Reduced initial delay from 2s to 0.5s
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:2055-2086 (scenarios), 1670-1686 (buttons)

3. **Mobile Scroll Optimization**
   - Disabled manual scrolling on phone chat (mobile only)
   - Prevents "scroll trap" - users can scroll page even when touching phone
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:461-468

### Phase 2: New Sections Added

4. **"What If AI Gets Stuck?" Section**
   - Shows graceful failure handling (4-step process)
   - Builds trust by admitting AI limitations
   - Animated phone icon, professional design
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:1483-1546

5. **Comparison Chart**
   - Table comparing AI vs Human vs Answering Service vs Voicemail
   - 7 feature rows with icons
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:1548-1625

6. **FAQ Section (8 Questions)**
   - Setup time, integrations, data ownership, cancellation policy, etc.
   - 2-column grid (responsive to 1 column)
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:1896-1996

   - Changed caller name to "Princeton AI Partners"
   - Circular avatar with light blue background
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:1605-1607, 1608

9. **Scenario Button Repositioning**
   - **Desktop**: Vertical stack to RIGHT of phone (side-by-side layout)
   - **Tablet/Mobile**: 2x2 grid BELOW phone (original position)
   - Responsive button layouts (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)
   - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:320-325 (hero-phone-section), 681-728 (responsive CSS)

10. **Comparison Table Enhancements**
    - Changed header from black to deep navy blue gradient (#0A2540 → #1A3A5F)
    - Added "⭐ Recommended" badge to AI column with subtle pulse animation
    - Blue checkmarks in AI column (instead of green) with glow effect
    - Left/right borders on AI column cells
    - Enhanced hover effects
    - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:762-765 (header color), 784-796 (badge), 823-826 (blue checkmarks)

11. **Removed Phone Scrollbar**
    - Completely hidden scrollbar for cleaner look
    - Works across all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE/Edge)
    - **File**: PhoneAgent.html:482-489

12. **Removed Benefits Section**
    - Eliminated redundant "Why Businesses Love AI Phone Support" section
    - Updated hero CTA from "See The Benefits" to "See How It Compares"
    - Cleaner, more focused page flow

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Conversation Scenarios (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Located at: PhoneAgent.html:2055-2086
const conversationScenarios = {
    appointment: [6 messages],
    faq: [5 messages],
    emergency: [5 messages],
    afterhours: [6 messages]
};
```

### Timeout Management
- **conversationTimeout**: Controls message sequence timing

@media (max-width: 991px) {
    .hero-phone-section {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
```

## 📋 What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Animation Research & Implementation

1. **React Bits Library Analysis**
   - Cloned https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits (1501 files)
   - Analyzed 79 animation components across 3 categories
   - Studied 7 key components: FadeContent, ScrollReveal, GlareHover, Magnet, StarBorder, ShapeBlur, BlurText
   - Extracted best practices: GPU acceleration, IntersectionObserver, smooth easing
   - **Reference**: react-bits/src/content/ directory

2. **Removed 3D Tilt Effect**
   - User feedback: "i dont like the tilt effect"
   - Removed rotateX/rotateY animations on timeline cards
   - Kept clean, professional aesthetic
   - **File**: checkin.html:1651 (comment explaining removal)

3. **Timeline Animation System**
   - **Magnet Effect** - Initially implemented, then removed (too aggressive)
   - **GlareHover Effect** - Subtle light reflection follows mouse (KEPT)
   - **StarBorder Effect** - Animated gradient border on hover (removed - too busy)
   - **Final Effect**: Scale + Float with elastic bounce
   - **File**: checkin.html:590-606

### Phase 2: Hover Effect Refinement

4. **Iteration on Hover Animations**
   - **Attempt 1**: Magnet + GlareHover + Animated Border + Color change
     - User: "effects are a bit overdone"
   - **Attempt 2**: Removed Magnet, kept glare and border
     - User: "color change makes text hard to read"
   - **Attempt 3**: Removed all color changes
     - User: "make the color lighter blue please"
   - **Attempt 4**: Added 3% blue tint on hover
     - User: "get rid of color change, just make it move cool"
   - **Final**: Scale + Float effect ONLY
     - Cards lift 15px, zoom 5%, smooth elastic bounce
     - User: "i love it"

5. **Final Hover Animation**
   - Transform: `translateY(-15px) scale(1.05)`
   - Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (elastic bounce)
   - Duration: 0.5s
   - Shadow: Enhanced depth on hover
   - **Zero color changes** - perfect text readability
   - **File**: checkin.html:602-606

### Phase 3: Demo Files Integration

6. **Fixed 404 Errors**
   - **Problem**: demo_cashier.html and demo_signup.html not in repo

## 🎨 Animation Design Decisions

### What We Tried & Why

**Option 1: Magnet + GlareHover + StarBorder + Color Change**
- ❌ Too aggressive, pulled cards too far
- ❌ Color change made text hard to read
- ❌ Border animation too busy
- **User Feedback**: "effects are a bit overdone"

**Option 2: Elastic Bounce (Card lifts with spring)**
- ✅ Fun and playful
- ❌ User wanted something different
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`

**Option 3: Scale + Float (FINAL CHOICE)**
- ✅ Smooth zoom and lift
- ✅ Professional and clean
- ✅ Excellent readability
- ✅ Elastic easing for premium feel
- **User Feedback**: "i love it"
- Transform: `translateY(-15px) scale(1.05)`
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`

### Animation Philosophy from React Bits

**Performance Best Practices**:
- GPU acceleration: `transform` and `opacity` only
- `willChange: transform` for smooth rendering
- Damping/lerping for natural motion
- Clean event listener management
- IntersectionObserver for scroll triggers

**Timing Standards**:
- Durations: 300-800ms for interactions
- Stagger delays: 50-200ms between elements
- Easing: power2.out, back.out, elastic.out (avoid linear)

**User Experience**:
- Observe once, then disconnect (performance)
- Touch-friendly on mobile
- Disable heavy effects on small screens
- Zero color changes for readability

## 💡 Ideas Tried & Abandoned

### Magnet Effect
- Cards pull toward cursor when nearby
- **Why Removed**: Too aggressive, user felt "overdone"
- **Code**: Completely removed from checkin.html

### Animated Gradient Border
- Flowing blue gradient around card on hover
- **Why Removed**: Too busy with other effects
- **Code**: Removed in favor of simpler shadow

### Color Changes on Hover
- Blue tint background on hover (3% opacity)
- **Why Removed**: User wanted zero color changes
- **User Quote**: "get rid of the color change, just make it move cool"

### Glare Hover Effect
- Subtle light reflection following mouse
- **Status**: Initially kept, later removed in final simplification
- **Code**: Simplified away when focusing on Scale+Float only

## 📋 What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment & Planning

1. **User Feedback on Existing Design**
   - **Problem**: Page was "very simple", "very boring", "not updated"
   - **Missing**: AI Phone Receptionist solution (only 5 of 6 solutions shown)
   - **Layout**: Static tab system with text-only content
   - **Request**: "be creative but it still has to be functional and professional"

2. **Design Options Presented (User Chose Option 1)**
   - Option 1: Solution Preview Cards (initially implemented)
   - Option 2: Solutions Working Together Section
   - Option 3: Before vs After Comparison
   - Option 4: Interactive Solution Selector
   - Option 5: Solution Matrix Grid
   - **User Response**: "go with option 1 lets see how it looks please take your time"

### Phase 2: First Implementation - Card Grid (Rejected)

3. **Initial Card Grid Design**
   - Created 6 solution cards in 3-column grid
   - Added missing Phone Agent card
   - Scale+Float hover animations (from checkin.html)
   - Metrics badges, preview boxes, icons
   - **User Reaction**: "i dont love the design to be honest"

4. **User Requested Alternative**
   - "can you see what react bits has to offer"
   - "something super cool and super unique like a carousel that's high end"
   - "give me some options!"

### Phase 3: Creative Brainstorming - 6 Unique Options

5. **Design Options Presented**
   - **Option 1**: Infinite Loop Carousel (horizontal auto-scroll)
   - **Option 2**: Vertical Marquee Stack (parallax waterfall)
   - **Option 3**: Spotlight Carousel (center-focus 3D)
   - **Option 4**: Magnetic Hover Grid (cards react to cursor)
   - **Option 5**: Expanding Accordion Slider (vertical strips)
   - **Option 6**: Stacked Cards (swipeable Tinder-style)
   - **User Response**: "can you combine 2 and 6. what do u think about that. love your options this is exactly what I was looking for"

### Phase 4: Final Implementation - Parallax Card Stack

6. **"Parallax Card Stack" Design (Option 2+6 Hybrid)**
   - 2 vertical columns of auto-scrolling cards
   - Left column: slower (40s → 35s loop)
   - Right column: faster (30s → 28s loop)
   - Infinite loop with duplicated card sets
   - Hover any column to pause all scrolling
   - Minimal card design: icon, title, tagline, arrow indicator
   - **User Approval**: "i think 2 columns is fine on desktop. loop infinately but if hover then stop and allow each to be clickable obviously. make sense?"

### Phase 5: Optimization & Polish

7. **Page Length Reduction**
   - **Problem**: Page was 2503px tall (marquee 1818px!)
   - **Solution**: Fixed 800px height container
   - **Result**: 1484px total (40% shorter)
   - Tighter spacing throughout
   - **User**: "the page is still too long"

8. **Background Effect Iterations**
   - **First**: Mouse-following blur (z-index: -1, behind everything)
   - **User**: "the mouse blur is not available where I want it! it's not near the cards"
   - **Attempt 1**: Increased z-index to 5, added mix-blend-mode
   - **User**: "it does not follow my mouse everywhere"
   - **Final**: Replaced with animated gradient mesh background
     - 2 floating blue gradient orbs
     - Top-right: 20s animation loop
     - Bottom-left: 25s animation loop
     - Organic, lava-lamp effect
     - Always visible, unique to solutions page

9. **Color Refinement**
   - **Initial**: Purple-blue gradient in mouse blur
   - **User**: "just keep it blue! no purple :)"
   - **Final**: Pure blue gradient (#0A84FF)

10. **Final Polish**
    - Reduced card sizes (280px → 240px min-height)
    - Tighter gaps (2rem → 1.25rem)
    - Smaller icons (80px → 70px)
    - Faster animations for perceived speed
    - Bottom gradient fade (200px → 150px)
    - **User**: "this is great - thanks a ton"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Parallax Marquee Structure
```css
/* Located at: solutions.html:336-355 */
.solutions-marquee {
    padding: 40px 0 40px;
    max-height: 800px;  /* Fixed height */
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;
    gap: 1.5rem;
}

.marquee-column {
    height: 800px;  /* Fixed height */
    overflow: hidden;
}

.marquee-track {
    animation: scrollUp 35s linear infinite;  /* Left column */
    /* OR */
    animation: scrollUp 28s linear infinite;  /* Right column */
}
```

### Infinite Scroll Animation
```css
@keyframes scrollUp {
    0% { transform: translateY(0); }
    100% { transform: translateY(-50%); }
}
```

**How it works**:
- Each column contains 6 cards (3 unique + 3 duplicates)
- Animation moves from 0% to -50% (moves exactly one set)
- When it reaches -50%, the duplicate set looks identical to start
- Creates seamless infinite loop

### Hover Pause Functionality
```css
.marquee-column:hover .marquee-track {
    animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

### Animated Gradient Background
```css
/* Located at: solutions.html:38-85 */
.animated-gradient-bg::before {
    background: radial-gradient(circle, #0A84FF, rgba(10, 132, 255, 0.2));
    animation: float1 20s ease-in-out infinite;
}

.animated-gradient-bg::after {
    background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(0, 96, 206, 0.6), rgba(10, 132, 255, 0.1));
    animation: float2 25s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes float1 {
    0%, 100% { transform: translate(0, 0) scale(1); }
    33% { transform: translate(100px, 150px) scale(1.1); }
    66% { transform: translate(-50px, 100px) scale(0.9); }
}
```

**Visual Effect**:
- Creates organic, lava-lamp-like movement
- 2 independent orbs with different timing
- Always visible in background
- Unique to solutions page

### Card Design
```html
<a href="checkin.html" class="solution-card">
    <div class="card-icon">
        <i class="fas fa-gift"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="card-header">
        <h3>Automated Loyalty</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="card-tagline">Drive repeat visits with points, rewards, and personalized offers—no app needed.</p>
    <div class="card-arrow">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>
    </div>
</a>
```

**Minimal Design Philosophy**:
- Icon + Title + Tagline + Arrow
- No metrics badges (too busy)
- No preview boxes (simplified)
- Center-aligned, clean
- Blue gradient top border on hover
- Circle arrow transforms to gradient

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Playwright Dimensions Test
```
Before Optimization:
- Total height: 2503px
- Marquee height: 1818px (!!!)

After Optimization:
- Total height: 1484px (40% reduction)
- Marquee height: 800px (fixed)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Page Load**: Instant (mostly CSS)
- **Animation**: Smooth 60fps (GPU-accelerated transforms)
- **Marquee Speed**: Left 35s, Right 28s (feels dynamic but not rushed)
- **Hover Response**: Instant pause/resume

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop** (≥768px): 2 columns side-by-side, auto-scroll enabled
- **Mobile** (<768px): 1 column, auto-scroll disabled, natural scrolling
- **Mobile Optimization**: Right column hidden, shows all 6 cards in left column only

---

## 💡 Ideas Tried & Abandoned

### Mouse-Following Cursor Blur
- **Tried**: Blue blur that follows cursor
- **Problem**: z-index issues, wasn't visible over cards
- **User**: "the mouse blur is not available where I want it"
- **Abandoned**: Replaced with animated gradient mesh

### Purple Gradient Accents
- **Tried**: Purple-blue gradient for variety
- **User**: "just keep it blue! no purple :)"
- **Fixed**: Pure blue (#0A84FF) throughout

### Metrics Badges & Preview Boxes
- **Tried**: Cards with "40% increase", "24/7 availability" badges
- **Problem**: Too cluttered for minimal marquee design
- **Abandoned**: Simplified to icon, title, tagline, arrow

### 3-Column Grid Layout
- **Tried**: Traditional card grid (initial Option 1)
- **User**: "i dont love the design to be honest"
- **Abandoned**: Completely replaced with parallax marquee

## Session: October 15, 2025 (Evening) - Advanced Interactive Animations for Portfolio Mockups

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

**Primary Goal**: Replace simple scroll-triggered fade-in animations with professional-grade interactive animations across all 4 portfolio mockups (Stimi, Medical, Real Estate, Restaurant).

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All animations implemented and tested

**Context**: User provided critical feedback that scroll animations felt like "one scrollable page" and wanted "fun cool animations from our animation library" to "showcase our powers."

---

## 📋 What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Animation Strategy & Planning

1. **User Feedback Analysis**
   - **Problem**: Simple scroll-triggered fade-ins were not impressive enough
   - **User Quote**: "I don't like how you made it all like one scrollable page. I wanted like fun cool animations from our animation library. some cool ass shit uk showcase our powers!"
   - **Request**: Keep separate pages but add interactive showcase animations
   - **Goal**: Demonstrate technical depth and animation capabilities

2. **Animation Plan Created**
   - Detailed plan for each mockup with specific animation types
   - Leveraged existing GSAP library (already loaded on websitemanagement.html)
   - Focused on mouse interactions, particle systems, 3D effects
   - User directive: "don't be afraid to really increase the level of detail without it being cringe"

### Phase 2: Stimi Mockup (Social Gaming Platform)

3. **Implemented 9 Interactive Animation Systems**
   - **Mouse-follow gradient orbs** (2 orbs, cyan & pink, smooth lerp interpolation)
   - **Particle burst system** (8 particles explode from prop cards on hover)
   - **3D tilt effects** (cards rotate based on mouse position with perspective)
   - **Phone glow animation** (dynamic drop-shadow with random pulse every 2s)
   - **Magnetic buttons** (CTAs pull toward cursor with spring physics)
   - **Neon pulse** (continuous glow animation on hero CTA button)
   - **Flip animations** (odds buttons flip with 3D card effect on hover)
   - **Ripple clicks** (water ripple effect on all button clicks)
   - **Mouse-repel icons** (sport icons push away from cursor within 150px radius)
   - **File**: mockups/stimi.html (1,440 lines total)

4. **Technical Implementation Details**
   ```javascript
   // Mouse-follow orbs with lerp smoothing
   orb1X += (mouseX - orb1X) * 0.15;  // Fast follow
   orb2X += (mouseX - orb2X) * 0.08;  // Slower lag

   // Particle burst with radial distribution
   const angle = (index / 8) * Math.PI * 2;
   const velocity = 50 + Math.random() * 30;

   // 3D tilt based on mouse position
   const rotateX = (y - centerY) / 20;
   const rotateY = -(x - centerX) / 20;
   ```

### Phase 3: Medical Mockup (Dental Practice)

5. **Implemented 8 Interactive Animation Systems**
   - **Spotlight effect** (radial gradient spotlight follows mouse on doctor cards)
   - **Heartbeat animation** (pulsing icon on Emergency Care service - CSS animation)
   - **20 floating particles** (medical-themed particles continuously float upward)
   - **Animated stat counters** (numbers count up smoothly: 15,000+, 25 Years, 4.9/5.0, 100%)
   - **3D tilt with glare sweep** (service & doctor cards tilt + light sweep on hover)
   - **Parallax hero** (background image shifts with scroll at 0.5x speed)
   - **Staggered testimonials** (cards appear sequentially with 150ms delay)
   - **Button ripples** (click ripple effect on all CTA buttons)
   - **File**: mockups/medical.html (1,230 lines total)

6. **Stat Counter Implementation**
   ```javascript
   const statValues = ['15000', '25', '4.9', '100'];
   const increment = target / 50;  // 50 frames to count up

   if (isDecimal) {
       stat.textContent = current.toFixed(1) + '/5.0';
   } else if (index === 0) {
       stat.textContent = Math.floor(current).toLocaleString() + '+';
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Real Estate Mockup (Luxury Living)

7. **Implemented 9 Interactive Animation Systems**
   - **Gold particle trail** (luxury gold sparkles follow cursor everywhere, 50ms interval)
   - **Ken Burns effect** (hero image slowly zooms from 1.0 to 1.1 over 20s, already existed)
   - **3D tilt with shimmer** (residence cards rotate + shimmer/glare effects)
   - **Animated property stats** (counters animate: 182, $2.5M+, 2026, 10K)
   - **Magnetic gallery** (amenities image pulls toward cursor, subtle movement)
   - **Gold burst on hover** (6 particles burst from residence card corners on hover)
   - **Staggered reveals** (amenities list items slide in from left, 80ms delays)
   - **Parallax scrolling** (hero background translates at 0.3x scroll speed)
   - **Button gold glow** (buttons emit 3 gold particles on hover)
   - **File**: mockups/realestate.html (971 lines total)

8. **Gold Particle Trail System**
   ```javascript
   let lastParticleTime = 0;
   const particleInterval = 50;  // 20 particles per second

   function createGoldParticle(x, y) {
       particle.style.background = 'linear-gradient(135deg, #D4AF37, #FFD700)';
       particle.style.boxShadow = '0 0 6px rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.8)';
       // Sparkle animation: rise + fade + shrink
   }
   ```

### Phase 5: Restaurant Mockup (French Dining)

9. **Implemented 10 Interactive Animation Systems**
   - **Magnetic custom cursor** (gold ring cursor + delayed dot, mix-blend-mode: difference)
   - **Candlelight flicker** (warm ambient glow follows mouse, intensifies on dark sections)
   - **Menu stagger entrance** (all menu items slide in sequentially, 60ms delay each)
   - **Wine glass pour** (wine fill rises to 70% height in glass icons on scroll)
   - **Chef signature reveal** (name types out letter-by-letter with gold underline)
   - **Gallery magnetic zoom** (images follow mouse, cursor enlarges to 80px on hover)
   - **Click to expand** (gallery photos zoom to 2x scale on click, toggle)
   - **Experience features stagger** (features list animates in from left, 150ms delays)
   - **Golden glow hovers** (buttons get gold shadow + 60px cursor on hover)
   - **Parallax hero** (background image shifts with scroll at 0.5x speed)
   - **File**: mockups/restaurant.html (1,092 lines total)

10. **Custom Cursor System**
    ```javascript
    // Dual cursor: ring (instant) + dot (smooth follow)
    cursor.style.left = cursorX + 'px';  // Ring follows immediately

    dotX += (cursorX - dotX) * 0.3;      // Dot lerps smoothly
    cursorDot.style.left = dotX + 'px';

    // Context-aware sizing
    cursor.style.width = '40px';  // Default
    cursor.style.width = '60px';  // On buttons
    cursor.style.width = '80px';  // On gallery
    ```

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing

      - tests/screenshots/stimi-hero-for-sora.png

14. **First SORA Prompt Delivered (Restaurant)**
    - Analyzed restaurant hero screenshot (dark charcoal/navy fine dining interior)
    - Created detailed 10-second cinematic prompt:
      - Slow dolly-in shot through upscale French restaurant
      - Golden hour lighting (2700K-3000K), moody ambiance
      - Empty but recently set, pristine tablecloths
      - Subtle candlelight flicker, warm pendant lights
      - RED Komodo 6K aesthetic, shallow depth of field (f/2.8-f/4)
      - 35mm film grain texture, anamorphic feel
    - **File Structure Planned**:
      ```
      assets/videos/
      ├── restaurant-hero.mp4
      ├── realestate-hero.mp4
      ├── medical-hero.mp4
      └── stimi-hero.mp4
      ```
    - **Status**: Waiting for user to generate first video before creating remaining 3 prompts

- **GPU Acceleration**: Only transform and opacity animations
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: All cursor tracking uses RAF
- **Lerp Interpolation**: Smooth cursor following with different speeds
- **Event Cleanup**: All listeners properly managed, no memory leaks
- **Conditional Loading**: Heavy effects disabled on mobile/small screens

### Animation Timing Standards
- **Hover transitions**: 0.3s - 0.5s with elastic easing
- **Particle animations**: 1.5s - 2s fade-out cycles
- **Cursor orbs**: 0.15s - 0.3s lerp (different speeds for depth)
- **Stat counters**: 30-40ms intervals for smooth counting
- **Menu staggers**: 60-150ms delays between items

### Mouse Interaction Patterns
- **Follow**: Orbs, candlelight, spotlight (smooth lerp)
- **Repel**: Sport icons push away from cursor
- **Magnetic**: Buttons pull toward cursor within radius
- **Tilt**: Cards rotate based on mouse position (3D perspective)
- **Custom Cursor**: Ring + dot with context-aware sizing

### Particle Systems
- **Burst**: 8 particles in radial pattern (Stimi prop cards)
- **Trail**: Continuous sparkles following cursor (Real Estate gold)
- **Float**: 20 particles rising continuously (Medical)
- **Hover Burst**: 6 particles from corners (Real Estate residences)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights

### Stimi: Particle Burst System
```javascript
function createParticle(x, y, index) {
    const angle = (index / 8) * Math.PI * 2;       // 360° / 8 = 45° apart
    const velocity = 50 + Math.random() * 30;       // Random speed
    const offsetX = Math.cos(angle) * velocity;
    const offsetY = Math.sin(angle) * velocity;

    particle.style.background = index % 2 === 0 ? 'var(--cyan)' : 'var(--pink)';
    setTimeout(() => particle.remove(), 1500);
}
```

### Medical: Spotlight Effect
```javascript
card.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const y = e.clientY - rect.top;

    spotlight.style.left = (x - 150) + 'px';
    spotlight.style.top = (y - 150) + 'px';
    spotlight.style.opacity = '1';  // 300px diameter spotlight
});
```

### Real Estate: Gold Particle Trail
```javascript
document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastParticleTime > 50) {  // 20 particles/sec
        createGoldParticle(e.clientX, e.clientY);
        lastParticleTime = now;
    }
});

@keyframes sparkle {
    0% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1) translateY(0); }
    100% { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0) translateY(-80px); }
}
```

### Restaurant: Custom Magnetic Cursor
```javascript
// Dual cursor system
let cursorX = 0, cursorY = 0;
let dotX = 0, dotY = 0;

function animateCursor() {
    dotX += (cursorX - dotX) * 0.3;  // Smooth follow
    dotY += (cursorY - dotY) * 0.3;

    cursor.style.left = cursorX + 'px';      // Ring: instant
    cursorDot.style.left = dotX + 'px';      // Dot: delayed

    requestAnimationFrame(animateCursor);
}
```
