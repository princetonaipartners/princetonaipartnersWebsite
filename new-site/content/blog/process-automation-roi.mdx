## Why Most Automation ROI Calculations Fail

The typical automation pitch goes something like: "This saves 10 hours per week, so it's worth $500 per week in labor costs."

This calculation ignores reality:

- Those 10 hours don't disappear—they get reallocated to other work
- Implementation takes time and creates temporary productivity loss
- Maintenance and edge cases consume ongoing attention
- Not all time savings translate to equivalent value

Let's build a framework that accounts for what actually happens when you automate.

## The Real ROI Formula

**Automation ROI = (Value Created - Total Cost) / Total Cost**

Where:

- **Value Created** = Direct savings + Opportunity value + Risk reduction
- **Total Cost** = Development + Implementation + Maintenance + Opportunity cost

Let's break down each component.

## Calculating Value Created

### Direct Labor Savings

Start with the obvious: how much time does the process currently take?

```
Weekly hours × Average hourly cost × 52 weeks = Annual labor cost
```

But here's the critical adjustment: **not all saved time creates equivalent value.**

Time savings only convert to real dollars when they enable one of these outcomes:

1. **Headcount reduction**: Rare, but sometimes legitimate
2. **Avoiding a hire**: A growing team that would have needed additional staff
3. **Higher-value work**: Time redirected to revenue-generating activities
4. **Extended capacity**: Handling more volume without proportional cost increase

For most automation projects, you should discount the theoretical time savings by 40-60% to reflect reality.

### Error Reduction Value

Manual processes make mistakes. Quantify the cost of those errors:

- **Correction time**: Hours spent fixing mistakes
- **Customer impact**: Refunds, credits, churn from errors
- **Compliance risk**: Regulatory penalties, audit failures
- **Reputation damage**: Harder to quantify but often significant

A process with a 2% error rate that costs $500 per error incident, running 1,000 times annually, has a $10,000 annual error cost.

### Speed Value

Some processes create value by happening faster:

- **Customer response**: Faster quotes mean higher win rates
- **Billing cycles**: Invoice immediately instead of monthly batching
- **Decision latency**: Automated data collection enables faster pivots

This is often undervalued because it's harder to quantify, but it can be the largest component of value.

## Calculating True Cost

### Development Cost

The upfront investment in building the automation. Include:

- External development costs (if using a partner)
- Internal team time (often underestimated)
- Software licenses and infrastructure
- Testing and QA effort

### Implementation Cost

Getting the automation into production creates its own cost:

- **Transition period**: Running old and new processes simultaneously
- **Training**: Team members learning new workflows
- **Documentation**: Creating guides for edge cases and maintenance
- **Debugging**: First month of real-world issues

Expect implementation cost to equal 20-40% of development cost.

### Ongoing Maintenance

Automation isn't "set and forget." Budget for:

- **Monitoring**: Alerts, dashboards, regular health checks
- **Updates**: When source systems change, automations break
- **Edge cases**: New scenarios the automation doesn't handle
- **Improvements**: Optimizations discovered after launch

Plan for 15-25% of development cost annually for maintenance.

## The Prioritization Matrix

Not all processes are equal candidates for automation. Score each opportunity across four dimensions:

### Frequency (1-5)
How often does this process run?
- 1: Monthly or less
- 3: Weekly
- 5: Multiple times daily

### Time per Instance (1-5)
How long does each execution take?
- 1: Under 5 minutes
- 3: 15-30 minutes
- 5: Over an hour

### Consistency (1-5)
How repeatable is the process?
- 1: Every instance is unique
- 3: Core steps consistent with variations
- 5: Identical every time

### Value per Instance (1-5)
What's the impact of each execution?
- 1: Low-stakes internal task
- 3: Moderate business impact
- 5: Revenue-critical or compliance-required

**Automation Priority Score = Frequency × (Time + Consistency + Value)**

Processes scoring above 40 are typically strong candidates. Below 20, the automation likely isn't worth the investment.

## Example: Invoice Processing

Let's apply this framework to a real scenario.

**Current State:**
- 200 invoices processed monthly
- 25 minutes average per invoice
- 3% error rate requiring 30 minutes to correct
- One part-time employee (20 hours/week at $25/hour)

**Manual Cost Calculation:**
- Processing time: 200 × 25 min = 83 hours/month
- Error correction: 6 errors × 30 min = 3 hours/month
- Total monthly cost: 86 hours × $25 = $2,150
- Annual cost: $25,800

**Automation Investment:**
- Development: $8,000
- Implementation: $2,400
- Year 1 maintenance: $1,200
- Total year 1 cost: $11,600

**Value Calculation:**
- Direct savings (discounted 50%): $12,900
- Error elimination: $4,500
- Speed value (faster payments): $3,000
- Total year 1 value: $20,400

**ROI: ($20,400 - $11,600) / $11,600 = 76%**

Year 2+ ROI improves significantly as development costs are amortized.

## Common Automation Targets

Based on our implementation experience, these processes typically show the strongest ROI:

1. **Data entry and transfer**: Moving information between systems
2. **Report generation**: Compiling data from multiple sources
3. **Customer onboarding**: Account setup, welcome sequences, provisioning
4. **Invoice and payment processing**: Matching, approval routing, payment initiation
5. **Inventory and order management**: Stock updates, reorder triggers, fulfillment notifications

## When Not to Automate

Some processes shouldn't be automated—at least not yet:

- **High variability**: Each instance requires significant judgment
- **Low volume**: The automation costs more than the manual process
- **Rapidly changing**: The process itself is still evolving
- **Politics, not process**: The real problem is organizational, not operational

Sometimes the answer is "simplify the process" rather than "automate the complexity."
